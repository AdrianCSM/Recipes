<h2>Ingredients for sauce</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>½ (12 ounce) can CONTADINA® Tomato Paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingredients for the curst</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise® Yeast</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 ⅓ cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
    <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Toppings</h2>
<ul>
    <li> 1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL® Pepperoni</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps </h3>
<ol>
    <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
    <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
    <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
    <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
    <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
    <li>   Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
